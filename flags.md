# Relevant flags listed below

Remove short flags unless the option is often used.
Use the same short flags as original `imapgrap` only if it is an abbreviation of the long form.

## Turned into commands

`--list`, `-l`: List the mailboxes available for download (`list` command)
`--download`, `-d`: Download mailboxes to separate files/folders (`download` command)
`--about`: Display detailed info (`about` command)
`--version`: Print version (merge with `about` command)

## Replaced by fixed default value

`--help`, `-h`: Print help with command options (auto generated by framework)
`--mbox`, `-B`: Download into Mbox format (will not be made available, maildir is the way to go)
`--maildir`, `-M`: Download into Maildir format (the new fixed default, thus no flag needed)
`--ssl`, `-S`: Use SSL connection (always force encrypted connections)
`--quiet`, `-q`: Don't display any output (don't write to `stdout` at all and only log to `stderr`, don't support log levels for now)
`--verbose`, `-v`: Verbose output (see `--quiet`, always log)
`--debug`: Print debug output (see `--quiet`, always log)
`--localuser`, `-L`: User that writes to the mailboxes, use only when invoking imapgrab as root (do not handle being called as `root`, users should use `sudo` or other mechanisms to change the calling user, otherwise we simply run as `root`)

## General options

`--server`, `-s`: IP or domain of server (make this an argument and not a flag as it is always needed)
`--port`, `-P`: Port of server (replace `-P` by `-p`)
`--username`, `-u`: Username for account (make this an argument and not a flag as it is awlays needed, possibly as `<USER>@<SERVER>:<PORT>`)
`--password`, `-p`: Password for account (read from stdin or from env var, try to echo warning if read via the CLI, remove short flag)

## Options for downloading

`--all`, `-a`: Force download all mail in a mailbox (How does this differ from `_ALL_`?)
`--folder`, `-f`: Path to folder (creates directory in current working dir with name derived from mailbox by default)
`--mailboxes`, `-m`: Comma separated list of mailboxes to download (allow specifying this option multiple times to prevent having to care about field separation)

### Details for mailboxes flag

- (i.e. `"Box1, Box2, Box3"`) -> inclusive specification
- (`"{,}"` for non-separating commas) -> no longer needed because we allow `-m` multiple times
- (`"_ALL_"` for all mailboxes)
- (`"_ALL_, -Box1"` to except Box1 from `_ALL_`)
- (`"_ALL_, -_Gmail_"` to except `[Gmail]*` and `[Google Mail]*` folders)
- (`"_Gmail_"` for all `[Gmail]/*` or `[Google Mail]/*` folders)
- (required for `-d`) -> What does this mean? Probably not needed
